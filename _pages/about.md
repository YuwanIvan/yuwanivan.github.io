Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Principal Researcher at the [Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/), [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), working with Professor [Baris Ata](https://sites.google.com/view/baris-ata/). 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics (Financial Mathematics) from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), in July 2025, advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/14.html). I was also very fortunate to be supervised by Professors [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/), [Renyuan Xu](https://renyuanxu.github.io/), and [Weijie Su](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/) on particular projects.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Financial Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.pku.edu.cn) and a second major in Economics from the [National School of Development](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn), both at Peking University, in 2020.

My research interests include:

* Stochastic Modeling, Stochastic Control and Stochastic Games
* Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning with Applications in Finance
* Market Microstructure, High-frequency and Algorithmic Trading
