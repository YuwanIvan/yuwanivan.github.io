Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn), advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/14.html). I was also very fortunate to be supervised by Professors [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/), [Renyuan Xu](https://renyuanxu.github.io/) and [Weijie Su](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/) on particular projects. 

Previously, I received my Bachelor Degree in financial mathematics ([School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.pku.edu.cn)) and economy ([National School of Development](https://nsd.pku.edu.cn)) from Peking University in 2020.

My research interests include:
* Market Microstructure, High-frequency and Algorithmic Trading
* Stochastic Modeling, Stochastic Control and Stochastic Games 
* Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning with Applications in Finance
