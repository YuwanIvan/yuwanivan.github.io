I am a second Ph.D. student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Minghua Deng. My research interest includes high-dimensional statistics and biostatistics.

Previously, I received a BS in Statistics from Peking University in 2022.
